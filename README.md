### Rock Paper Scissors
Its my goto for learning something useful in a new language or framework.

Nothing about this repo is platform or language dependant. It mearly attempts to outline some goals associated with building a RPS game in a number of cohesive steps.

### Steps
1. Explore the Random Number Generator
2. Select an answer using a Random Selection
3. Build A RPS service that contains the rules for win, lose, and, draw
4. Make a Bot that can play the game
5. Make the bot smarter
6. Build an interface for the game for a human


### How to start
1. Fork/Clone this repo
2. Read the `STEP_ONE` file
3. Try and build something by putting your code right in your fork and committing it
4. If you get stuck `Open and Issue` on your fork and include `@ninjapanzer` in the issue somewhere

### Some conventions
Being these instructions are language agnostic I will use some special characters to help illustrate variables you will have to assume for your work
- `<` and `>` will surround text that describes the required info you will add yourself
- `[` and `]` will surround text that describes optional information
I will use these together. From time to time. Here is an example:
    <Your Language> [Pseudo]Random
    Lets say our language is `Ruby` we could expand this example to two statements
    `Ruby` `Pseudo`Random
    OR
    `Ruby` Random

Somtimes the text inside these characters represents info only you know or the specific text. It is understandable that the only time variable text will be present is between the `[` and `]` as a literal of required text would not need to be outlined with `<` and `>`
